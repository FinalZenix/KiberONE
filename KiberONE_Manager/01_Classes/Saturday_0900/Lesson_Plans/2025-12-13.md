# Lesson Plan: 13.12.2025 - Python: Flappy Bird (Gravity & Jump)

**Module:** Python (Pygame Zero)
**Topic:** Game Loop, Gravity, and User Input
**Goal:** Students will implement gravity (bird falling) and jumping (spacebar) for their Flappy Bird clone.

## Logistics
- **Date:** 13.12.2025
- **Time:** 09:00 - 11:00
- **Materials:** PyCharm/Mu Editor, `images` folder (bird, background).
- **Pre-Flight:** Ensure `pgzrun` works on all stations.

## Differentiation Strategies (Profiles)
- **Dimitru (Stören):**
    - **Seating:** Isolate in the front row, away from friends.
    - **Role:** Assign as "Quality Control Assistant" – once he finishes a step, he checks his neighbor's syntax (WITHOUT touching their keyboard).
- **Alex (Schnell):**
    - **Bonus Challenge:** "Can you make the bird rotate when it jumps?" or "Add a score variable that prints to the console when clicking."
- **Yasin (Langsam):**
    - **Support:** Pair near Alex (if Alex is willing to mentor) or focus ONLY on the `update()` function logic. Skip complex visuals if needed.
- **Jeongwon (Schüchtern):**
    - **Action:** Visit her station during the practical phase for a quiet 1-on-1 check. Do NOT ask her to demo her code on the main screen.

## Timeline (120m)

### 09:00 - 09:10: Warmup & Recap
- **Review:** What does `draw()` do? What does `update()` do?
- **Activity:** "Bug Hunt" – Show code with a missing `def` or colon on the projector. First to find it gets to choose the background music.

### 09:10 - 10:00: Core Learning (The Physics)
- **Concept:** Gravity is just `y = y + speed`.
- **Step 1: The Bird Actor**
  ```python
  bird = Actor('bird')
  bird.pos = (100, 100)
  gravity = 0.5
  velocity = 0
  ```
- **Step 2: The Update Loop (Gravity)**
  ```python
  def update():
      global velocity
      velocity = velocity + gravity
      bird.y = bird.y + velocity
  ```
- **Step 3: Jumping (Input)**
  ```python
  def on_key_down(key):
      global velocity
      if key == keys.SPACE:
          velocity = -10  # Counteract gravity
  ```

### 10:00 - 10:10: BREAK (Strict Screen Off)
- **Activity:** Physical stretch or quick game of "Simon Says" (German: "Kommando Pimperle") to burn energy.

### 10:10 - 10:45: Deep Work & Experimentation
- Students implement the code.
- **Teacher Focus:**
    - Check **Dimitru** immediately to keep him on task.
    - Give **Alex** the rotation challenge (`bird.angle`).
    - Help **Yasin** with the `global` keyword (common pitfall).

### 10:45 - 11:00: Fun/Review
- **Game:** "Flappy Fails" – Who has the funniest bug? (e.g., bird flies backwards, gravity is too strong).
- **Wrap-up:** Save files as `flappy_v1.py`.
