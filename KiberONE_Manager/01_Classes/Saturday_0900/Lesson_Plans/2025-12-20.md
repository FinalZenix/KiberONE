# Lesson Plan: 20.12.2025 - Python: Flappy Bird (Modular Expansion)

**Module:** Python (Pygame Zero)
**Topic:** Coordinate Systems, Conditionals, and Randomness
**Goal:** Modularly build the game world from ground movement to pipe collision.

## Logistics
- **Date:** 20.12.2025
- **Materials:** Existing project files in `Resources/Flappy_Bird/code/`.
- **Teaching Method:** Modular walkthrough (Section by Section).

## Differentiation Strategies (Profiles)
- **Dimitru (Stören):**
    - **Intervention:** After each PART is completed, ask him to explain the "Rule of Reset" (e.g., "Why did we set X to 300?").
- **Alex (Schnell):**
    - **Bonus:** After PART 4, ask him to implement a "Score" that increases every time the pipe resets.
- **Yasin (Langsam):**
    - **Support:** Keep him on PART 1 & 2. If he gets the ground and pipe moving, he has a "flying" game.
- **Jeongwon (Schüchtern):**
    - **Interaction:** 1-on-1 check-in specifically during PART 3 (Randomization) to ensure the logic of `randint` is clear.

## TIMELINE (120m)

### PART 1: The Infinite Treadmill (Ground Scroll)
- **Logic:** Bird is stationary, ground moves left.
- **Goal:** Two ground actors swap positions seamlessly.
- **Check:** Does the background seam look smooth?

### PART 2: The Resetting Pipe
- **Logic:** ONE pipe actor that moves left. If it leaves the screen, teleport it back to the right.
- `if pipe.right < 0: pipe.left = WIDTH`

### PART 3: The Random Factor (Module intro)
- **Logic:** Every time the pipe resets, change its Y position.
- **Lesson:** `import random` and `random.randint(min, max)`.

### PART 4: The Crash (Collision State)
- **Logic:** Introduce a variable `game_active = True`.
- **Conditional:** If `bird.colliderect(pipe)`, set `game_active = False`.
- **Result:** Code in `update()` only runs if `game_active` is True.

## Wrap Up (105-120m)
- **Playtest:** Who can survive 1 minute?
- **Teaser:** "In 2026, we add Lists for multiple pipes and Sound Effects!"
