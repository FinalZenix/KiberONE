# Lesson Plan: 20.12.2025 - Python: Flappy Bird (Obstacles & Movement)

**Module:** Python (Pygame Zero)
**Topic:** Lists (Pipes), Infinite Scroll, and Collision
**Goal:** Students will make the ground move (infinite loop) and spawn pipes that the bird must avoid.

## Logistics
- **Date:** 20.12.2025 (Last class before Christmas!)
- **Time:** 09:00 - 11:00
- **Materials:** Existing project files.
- **Pre-Flight:** Ensure everyone has their code from last week (`flappy_v1.py`).

## Differentiation Strategies (Profiles)
- **Dimitru (Stören):**
    - **Task:** Assign him to be the "Grid Master". He has to draw the coordinate system (X/Y) on the whiteboard to explain how pipes move left (`x -= speed`).
- **Alex (Schnell):**
    - **Bonus Challenge:** "The pipes are boring. Can you make them spawn at random heights?" (Hint: `random.randint`).
- **Yasin (Langsam):**
    - **Focus:** Just get ONE pipe moving. Don't worry about the list `[]` of pipes initially. Hardcode one pipe variable.
- **Jeongwon (Schüchtern):**
    - **Code Check:** Check if her `pipes.append()` logic is inside the `update` loop correctly. Common error: Appending 60 times per second.

## Timeline (120m)

### 09:00 - 09:15: Warmup & Repair
- **Fix:** Any broken code from last week.
- **Concept:** "The Illusion of Speed". The bird doesn't move forward; the world moves backward.

### 09:15 - 10:00: Core Learning (Infinite Scroll & Lists)
- **Step 1: Moving Ground (Infinite Loop)**
  - Logic: `ground.x -= 2`. If `ground.right < 0`, reset position.
  - *Visual:* Use two ground actors to make it seamless.
- **Step 2: The Pipe List**
  - Concept: We need MANY pipes, so we use a `list`.
  - Code:
    ```python
    pipes = []
    pipe = Actor('pipe-green')
    pipes.append(pipe)
    ```
- **Step 3: Moving the Pipes**
  - Loop through the list:
    ```python
    for pipe in pipes:
        pipe.x -= 2
    ```

### 10:00 - 10:10: BREAK (Strict Screen Off)
- **Christmas Special:** Quick round of "Christmas-themed Simon Says".

### 10:10 - 10:45: Deep Work (Spawning & RNG)
- **Challenge:** Pipes need to appear regularly.
- **Logic:**
  ```python
  if pipes[-1].x < WIDTH - 150:
      # Create new pair
  ```
- **Constraint:** Keep it simple. If lists are too hard for Yasin/Marlene, stick to ONE reusing pipe.

### 10:45 - 11:00: Collision & Wrap Up
- **The "Ouch" Moment:**
  ```python
  if bird.colliderect(pipe):
      print("Game Over")
  ```
- **End:** Play the game! It should be playable now (Bird jumps, pipes move, you die if you hit).
