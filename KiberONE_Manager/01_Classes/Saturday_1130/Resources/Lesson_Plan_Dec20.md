**Module:** MinecraftEdu (Legacy)
**Teacher:** Sergio (Sub for Ivan)
**Duration:** 120 Minutes

- **Mod:** ComputerCraftEdu 1.74 (Check mods folder).
- **Physical:** Whiteboard for drawing the grid/coordinates.

## 1. Setup & "The Law" (00:00 - 00:15)
*Goal: Assert control before opening the game.*

1.  **Do NOT let them touch computers yet.**
2.  **Introduction:** "I am Mr. Sergio. Today we are not playing Minecraft. We are learning **Robot Logic** inside Minecraft. If you play, you leave."
3.  **The "Freeze" Rule:** Explain that you have a "magic button" (Teacher Menu 'P' or 'M') that freezes everyone. Test it immediately once they log in.
4.  **Login:**
    *   Start Server (See Cheatsheet).
    *   Students Join `192.168.x.x` (or "Local Server").
    *   **IMMEDIATE FREEZE** once everyone is in.

## 2. Navigation & "Zone Defense" (00:15 - 00:45)
*Goal: Assess skill levels and separate the disruptors.*

*   **The Problem:** Kids disturbing neighbors.
*   **The Fix:** Assign each student a specific "Zone" or "Lane" in the tutorial world.
    *   "You are Player 1. You own Lane 1. If you enter Lane 2, your robot explodes (I will kick you)."
*   **Activity: The Obstacle Course (Tests 1-3 from `Stunde 1.md`)**
    *   Movement (WASD + Space).
    *   **Task:** Reach the end of the parkour lane.
    *   **Differentiation:**
        *   *Fast Kids:* "Do it backwards." "Do it without jumping."
        *   *Slow Kids:* Teleport them past the hard jump (Teacher Menu -> Teleport).

## 3. Intro to Logic (The Turtle) (00:45 - 00:60)
*Goal: Transition from "Player" to "Programmer".*

1.  **Regroup:** Freeze everyone. Teleport everyone to the **"Lab Area"** (Flat area).
2.  **Give Item:** Give everyone 1x **Turtle** and 1x **Remote** (Bedienpult).
    *   *Teacher Menu -> Give Items tab.*
3.  **The Concept:**
    *   "This is not a pet. It is a stupid robot. It only does EXACTLY what you tell it."
    *   Show the Remote GUI.
    *   **Challenge 1:** Make the turtle move forward 3 steps.

## 4. BREAK (00:60 - 00:70)
*   **RULES:** Screens OFF. Stand up. Stretch.

## 5. Turtle Programming (00:70 - 01:10)
*Goal: Solve problems using the Remote.*

*   **Task:** "The Miner"
    *   Place a block of Gold (or Wood) 5 blocks away.
    *   Program the Turtle to:
        1.  Move Forward (5 times).
        2.  Dig.
        3.  Come Back.
*   **Visual Programming:** correspond the arrow keys on the remote to the action.
    *   Explain the *Memory* (Program) vs *Direct Control*.
    *   Fill the grid on the remote with arrows.

## 6. Creative/Free Time (01:10 - 01:20)
*   Let them build *structures* for their turtles to destroy.
*   **Condition:** They must stay in their assigned lanes.

## Management Tactics (Cheatsheet)
*   **If they follow/hit others:**
    *   **Warning 1:** Freeze the specific player (Teacher Menu -> Players -> [Name] -> Freeze).
    *   **Warning 2:** "Jail" (Teleport to a Bedrock box/Cage).
    *   **Warning 3:** Kick from server.
*   **If they act smart/bored:**
    *   "Can you program the turtle to build a staircase? Show me."
