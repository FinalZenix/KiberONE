### 10.01.2026 - Construct 2: Rescue & Presentations
**Objective:** Fix "Broken Projects" from last term and finalize the Module with Presentations.

**Logistics:**
*   **Context:** This is a "Cleanup" session. Next week potentially back to Minecraft.
*   **Materials:** USB Stick with backup assets (Sonic sprites).
*   **Prerequisite:** **Sergio** (You) needs to review the "Construct 2 Rescue Guide" below.

**TIMELINE (Strict 120m)**
*   **00-15 (Triage):**
    *   **Status Check:** Ask everyone to open their "Sonic" project.
    *   **Identify Issues:** access who has a "Working Game" vs. "Broken Game".
    *   **Grouping:** Pair "Working" students with "Broken" students to help fix basic bugs.
*   **15-70 (The Workshop - Fixing Phase):**
    *   **Goal:** Every student must have a playable level (Start -> Jump -> Win/Die).
    *   **Priorities:**
        1.  **Movement:** Does Sonic move? (Check "Platform" behavior).
        2.  **Solids:** Does he fall through floor? (Check "Solid" behavior on ground).
        3.  **Spawns:** Does he spawn in the sky? (Check Image Points / Origin).
*   **60-70 (BREAK):** STRICTLY 10 Minutes. Screen off.
*   **70-100 (Presentations):**
    *   **Format:** Show & Tell.
    *   **Questions:** "What was the hardest bug you fixed?" / "What is your favorite mechanic?"
    *   **Note:** If projects are too broken, do a "Group Play" of the best working project instead.
*   **100-120 (Minecraft Transition):**
    *   If time permits, re-open MinecraftEdu world to ensure Turtles are ready for next week.

### CHEAT SHEET: Construct 2 Common Fixes (For Sergio)

**1. "My Player shouldn't fall off the world!"**
*   **Fix:** Add Behavior -> `BoundToLayout` to the Player Sprite.

**2. "The Enemy (Crab) walks off the edge!"**
*   **Fix:**
    *   Create a Red Box sprite (call it `EdgeMarker`). Make it invisible (`Initial Visibility = Invisible`).
    *   Place it at the edge of the platform.
    *   **Event Sheet:** `On Collision with EdgeMarker` -> `Crab: Invert Movement` (or Flip).

**3. "I press Play and it's just a white screen!"**
*   **Fix:** You might be running a Layout that has no objects.
    *   Check the "Project Bar" (Right Side). Double click `Layout 1`.
    *   Ensure sprites are on the "Game" Layer (not a locked/hidden layer).

**4. "My animations are weird/stuck!"**
*   **Fix:** Check **Origin Points**.
    *   Double click sprite -> Image Points (Target Icon).
    *   Ensure the "Origin" is at the **Bottom Middle** (feet) for ALL frames. If it shifts, the player "teleports" when animating.

**5. "It's too hard!"**
*   **Fix:** Adjust `Jump Strength` in Player Properties (Left Bar). Default is 650. Try 700 or adjust Gravity.
